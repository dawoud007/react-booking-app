##  divide components into small pieces
 first I divided the project into small components to be easy to handle
 found in component folder


### ready methods
Imade use of the given methods given in BookApi.js like getAll to get needed data
search to search for new books
update to update the shelf of books

## states,props
I used states and props to handle the data flow between each component 
and each component has own its attributes 

## inportant packeges
I installed 'react-router-dom' package to handle moving between search page and the main page
